      Purposes and legal basis of the data processing
    </h3>
    <p>
      The WebApp allows the user to access to a Reserved Area by entering his
      username and password.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the Reserved area has been accessed, a useful form is made available
      to the user to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        submit his job with the experiment metadata and details (clicking on the
        button “Submit”);
      </li>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        identify and access his results (clicking on the button “Results”).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When the user submits his job, he can optionally choose to receive job's
      results at his registered e-mail address.
    </p>
    <p>
      Personal data are processed by HT exclusively to offer a service to the
      data subject. If the data subject does not provide the data, HT will not
      be able to open the user account and offer its services.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legal basis of the processing, therefore, consists of the need to
      execute the request of the data subject, in compliance with Article 6,
      paragraph 1, letter b) of the GDPR.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provision of personal data by the data subject (authentication
      credentials) is necessary, as failure to provide it would make it
      impossible to activate the service. The provision of the e-mail by the
      user is optional.
    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">Nature of the data processed</h3>
    <p>HT collects the following personal data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="terms__list-item">
        Authentication credentials (username and related password);
      </li>
      <li class="terms__list-item">E-mail address.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      HT processes the data to provide to the data subject the authenticated
      access to the HT services.
    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">
      Recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data
    </h3>

      parties, unless the communication is required by law or is strictly
      necessary for the fulfillment of regulatory obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without prejudice to communications made in compliance with legal
      obligations, the personal data of the data subjects may be known,
      exclusively for the purposes listed in this Information, by:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li class="terms__list-item">

      Transfer of personal data to a third country or international organization

      Union, the same will only take place after the adoption of adequate

    </p>

    <h3 class="terms__article">Rights of the data subjects</h3>
